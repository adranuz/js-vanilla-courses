### How to use this folder

Design patterns in JS could be used in several different ways. 
I every folter are placed some examples for every pattern.
Each folder with files have a ReadME.md file with a description of the code.
The other files are JS files, that you should run with nodemon.
Mosly, the main file is called `main.js`, so, you should go to that folder and run it with `npx nodemon main.js`. In other cases, there will be not a main file, so run the unic file that is in the folder.
